			oh, when the wind would blow with rain and snow
			were not all bad
			we put our feet just where they had, had to go
			never to go

			the shattered soul
			following close but nearly twice as slow
			in my good times
			there were always golden rocks to throw
			at those who, those who admit defeat too late
			those were our times, those were our times
